# Face_Swap_deep-learning
In this project, I used opencv and dlib to extract faces of human-beings from a given image. I used a pretrained model to extract landmarks from the faces.
I started with downloading the pretrained model for face landmark and download the images from the internet on which I will work. Next I used CV2 and Dlib for preprocessing the images and used different functionalities to make reach to the end which is swapping the face of destination image with source image.
This project can be used for learning and understanding different concepts of computer vision. This project can be use to build Augmented Reality applications like Snapchat, etc.
